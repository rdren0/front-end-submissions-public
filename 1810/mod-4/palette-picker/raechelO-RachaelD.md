 # Code Quality

 #### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub (from either repository) that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/raechelo/Palette-Picker-fe/blob/63941a2b12010067739e06d92c41b8ef60b49dcb/src/Components/Project/Project.js#L19-L31)

 * Why were you proud of this piece of code?  
- Having a modal that could pop out and dispaly the projects and palette was on our nice to have list and it was great to be able to implement that with little issue.

 #### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/raechelo/Palette-Picker-fe/blob/63941a2b12010067739e06d92c41b8ef60b49dcb/src/Components/Project/Project.js#L51-L67)

 * Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
-For the same componenet We felt that there was a lot of repetition that we were sure how to remove. Utilitzing more loops would have made the code less wet
 #### Link to Design Inspiration

 * Show us what you used as design inspiration (another color picker site, a dribbble UI element, a user flow, etc.) and explain what you stole from it  
- We browsed flaticon until we found one that we thought suited our purposes and then worked around that, the colors were changed as we went based on other peoples feedback. 

 #### Reflection on New Concepts

 * Describe your thoughts on server-side testing  
- Serving side testing was a bit more striaght forward than what we were used to for front-end testing and we found it more enjoyable for that reason. 

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!
